# Consult Codex CLI (headless)

Run OpenAI's `codex` CLI non-interactively to get a second opinion (design review, plan
critique, adversarial check) from a *different model family* than Claude — the point is
decorrelated blind spots, not raw capability.

> Requires the `codex` CLI installed and OpenAI-authenticated on this machine. If `codex`
> isn't found, say so and fall back to Fable for the adversarial pass (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## The invocation

1. **Write the prompt to a file** (use the scratchpad dir, not a bash heredoc — more reliable):
   `…/scratchpad/codex-prompt.txt`
2. **Run**, feeding the prompt via stdin redirect and capturing the answer with `-o`:

```bash
timeout 300 codex exec \
  -c model_reasoning_effort=medium \
  --ephemeral \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  -s read-only \
  -o "<scratchpad>/codex-verdict.md" \
  < "<scratchpad>/codex-prompt.txt" \
  > "<scratchpad>/codex-progress.log" 2>&1
```

3. **Read the answer** from the `-o` file (`codex-verdict.md`). `stdout` is only progress.

## Why each flag (these are the gotchas that will bite you)

- **Prompt via `< promptfile` (stdin), NOT as a bare argument.** In a piped/non-TTY
  environment, `codex exec "my prompt"` prints *"Reading additional input from stdin…"* and
  **hangs forever** waiting for EOF. Redirecting a file to stdin gives the EOF.
- **`--ephemeral`** — no session persistence. Without it, a long or looping run can balloon a
  session-log JSONL under `~/.codex/sessions/` to **hundreds of MB** and never return.
- **`-o <file>`** — the final agent message is written here. **Do not parse stdout for the
  answer** — stdout is progress noise only.
- **`-s read-only`** — advisory/design use: Codex can read but not edit the tree. Use
  `-s workspace-write` only when you actually want it to make changes.
- **`--skip-git-repo-check`** — safe to run regardless of git state.
- **`-c model_reasoning_effort=medium`** — the default. Bumping to `high` costs more and runs
  longer; **ask the owner before using `high`**, then pass it for that one run. Add
  `-c web_search=live` if it needs the web. Add `-m <model>` to pin a model (else default).
  The owner's default (`~/.codex/config.toml`) is **`gpt-6-astra`**, the model they use for
  reviews ("astra"), so omitting `-m` already uses it. The short name `-m astra` is **rejected**
  ("not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account"); pin it as `-m gpt-6-astra` if needed.
- **`timeout <sec>`** — always wrap it (300–420s is typical) so a stuck run can't hang forever.

## Prompt shape — pick the mode

Codex answers a numbered list of specific questions well; a wall of prose less so. Two modes,
depending on whether the evidence is in the prompt or in the repo:

- **Design-prose mode** (the design/plan is described *inline* in the prompt — nothing to inspect):
  lead with *"OPINION ONLY — do NOT read files, edit, or run commands. Answer from the description
  below."* This keeps it fast and stops Codex wandering the tree. (Still run with `-s read-only`.)
- **Code / repository review mode** (the request references a diff, file paths, or "review the
  code"): **do NOT forbid reading** — Codex must inspect the evidence. Lead with *"Review the code.
  Read these files: <paths>. Do NOT edit anything or run commands — read-only advice only."* The
  `-s read-only` sandbox already blocks edits; the prompt just scopes what to read.

Never tell Codex to both "review the code" and "do not read files" — that contradiction produces a
critique of nothing. Match the instruction to the mode.

**"Do not run commands" counts as "do not read files."** Codex reads through the shell, so that
phrasing silently disarms it: it comes back asking you to paste the files, having inspected
nothing, and a whole run is wasted. In code-review mode say the opposite — *"you are in a
read-only sandbox, read the files yourself with whatever shell commands you need; the sandbox
already prevents edits."* `-s read-only` is what enforces safety, not the prompt.

For LibGlass, good things to hand Codex:
- anything that changes the upgrade path: `lib.impl` dispatch, hooks installed on frames,
  migration of older instances, the completion marker (a newer copy must run on frames an older
  copy built, and an older copy loading second must do nothing);
- anything that could break the additive-API contract (a removed or renamed function, field,
  region field, `TUNABLES` key or texture name);
- the `SetStatusBarColor` hook path, which can see secret-adjacent values from consumers;
- the render-cost budget of the glass layers (texture count, `OnUpdate` / animation use);
- packaging: `.pkgmeta`, what a consumer's zip ends up holding under `Libs/LibGlass-1.0/`.

**Always hand it `CLAUDE.md` alongside the diff or plan**, plus
`C:/Projects/References/PORTING-TBC-TO-FOREVER.md` and any `docs/` probe results. Those findings
were measured on the live client. Without them, a cold reviewer argues from Classic-era or Retail
behaviour that doesn't hold here: that auras throw for the whole group in combat, that secure
snippets and state drivers are broken, that some unit numbers are secret.
`C:/Projects/References/forever-api-1.60.1.70205.md` is the full API surface when a question
turns on whether something exists. The precedent embedded library is `C:/Projects/LibGroupBuffs`
(consumed by `C:/Projects/Priestly`), and the pilot consumer is `C:/Projects/GlassUnitFrames`.

Say what you have already established and ask it not to repeat that work. A clean "no defect found"
is a useful answer - ask for it explicitly, or you invite an invented finding.

## Concurrency / safety

- The owner may run **their own Codex sessions concurrently**. Multiple sessions on one account
  can serialize/slow each other.
- **Never kill Codex processes by pattern/name** — you may terminate the owner's sessions. If you
  must kill a stuck run, kill **only the exact PID you started** (`taskkill //PID <pid> //F`), and
  prefer just letting the `timeout` wrapper end it.
